# Supply Chain Analysis

## Domain: FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods)
The FMCG sector involves the production and distribution of essential and high-demand consumer goods, such as food, beverages, and personal care items. Supply chain efficiency and customer service are critical success factors, especially when entering new markets.
________________________________________
## Function:
The primary function of this project is Supply Chain Performance Management. It includes:
1.	Tracking Delivery Metrics: On-Time Delivery %, In-Full Delivery %, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %.
2.	Identifying Service Gaps: Detecting cities/customers with poor service levels.
3.	Strategic Decision Support: Providing actionable insights to address service issues and improve customer retention before expanding to new markets.

## Project Overview:
AtliQ Mart is a Gujarat-based FMCG manufacturer, operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. Their goal is to expand into Tier 1 cities within two years. However, a key problem has emerged:
-	Several key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to subpar service levels.
-	Essential products were often delivered late or not in full.
-	Management wants a data-driven solution to track and improve delivery performance daily, ensuring no further contracts are lost.
To address these issues, a dashboard was created to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Problem Statements:
1.	Decline in Key Customer Retention: Annual contracts were not renewed due to poor delivery performance.
2.	Service Issues in Delivery: A consistent failure in delivering essential products on time or in full.
3.	Lack of Real-Time Tracking: The supply chain team lacked a system to monitor daily performance against targets.
4.	Expansion Plans at Risk: Without resolving existing service gaps, expanding to Tier 1 cities would be challenging.

## Tools and Approach:
### Tools Used:
1.	Microsoft Power BI: For building dashboards and visualizing supply chain performance.
2.	Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial calculations.
### Approach:
1.	Understand Stakeholder Requirements: Gathered insights from the business review meeting and metric list to identify key objectives.
2.	Data Collection: Collected historical data on order delivery, customer contracts, and performance KPIs.
3.	Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed data in Excel, including handling missing values, formatting dates, and standardizing metrics.
4.	Metric Development:
-	Calculated On-Time Delivery %: Percentage of orders delivered within the expected time.
-	Calculated In-Full Delivery %: Percentage of orders delivered with the correct quantity.
-	Calculated OTIF Delivery %: Percentage of orders delivered both on time and in full.
5.	Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to display metrics by city, customer, product category, and time trends.
6.	Analysis:
-	Analyzed variances between actual and target service levels.
-	Highlighted underperforming cities, customers, and product categories.
-	Added insights beyond stakeholder requirements, such as category-wise performance and delivery time trends.

## Key Insights:
1.	Low OTIF Performance: Overall OTIF Delivery is only 29.02%, significantly below the target of 65.91%, indicating widespread service issues.
2.	City Performance Variations:
-	Ahmedabad has the highest In-Full Delivery (54.20%) but still lags the target (77.33%).
-	Surat outperforms in On-Time Delivery (61.21%) compared to other cities but has room for improvement.
3.	Customer-Specific Challenges:
-	Underperforming customers, such as Info Stores (41.16% In-Full Delivery) and Elite Mart (37.94%), likely experienced significant service failures.
-	High performers like Expression Stores (60.83%) provide a benchmark for improvement.
4.	Product Category Observations:
-	Beverages have the best Volume Fill Rate (96.54%), followed by Dairy (96.35%) and Food (96.41%).
-	Line Fill Rates are consistently low, with Food (65.59%) performing the worst.
5.	Trends Over Time: Delivery performance has remained stagnant or declined over months, suggesting recurring inefficiencies in the supply chain.
6.	Average Delivery Time: 0.42 days (10 hours) average delivery time is efficient, but poor In-Full and On-Time rates suggest issues in order accuracy and planning.

## Recommendations:
1.	Strengthen Delivery Performance:
-	Optimize route planning and warehouse operations to improve On-Time Delivery.
-	Implement stricter inventory checks to ensure accurate quantities are delivered.
2.	Focus on Underperforming Areas:
-	Conduct root cause analysis for low-performing cities like Vadodara (27.78% OTIF).
-	Target key customers with poor service levels, such as Info Stores, to rebuild trust and secure contracts.
3.	Enhance Real-Time Monitoring:
-	Implement a real-time tracking system to flag late or incomplete orders immediately.
-	Use predictive analytics to anticipate potential delivery failures and take preemptive action.
4.	Invest in Employee Training:
-	Train supply chain teams on using analytics for daily performance tracking and improving decision-making.
5.	Pilot Service Improvements Before Expansion:
-	Test service improvements in existing cities before expanding to Tier 1 metros.

## What We Learned from the Project:
1.	Data Transparency is Critical: Real-time tracking of KPIs like OTIF can help identify and address service issues promptly.
2.	Customer Retention Requires Consistent Service: Poor delivery performance directly impacts contract renewals and customer satisfaction.
3.	Segmentation Drives Better Insights: City-wise and customer-specific analysis helps prioritize areas for improvement.
4.	Room for Process Optimization: Even with quick average delivery times (0.42 days), other inefficiencies like incomplete or late deliveries can hinder overall performance.
5.	Scalability Needs Preparation: Resolving current service gaps is essential to ensure successful expansion into Tier 1 cities.
